DESCRIPTION
-----------
SIMOS18-specific version of LZSS routines to compress and decompress files. Note that the compressor will pad the compressed output file with 00 until the file size reaches a whole multiple of the AES block size â€“ because after compressing, the next step is usually to AES-encode

PlainText Input File -> LZSS(compress) -> AES(encode) -> CipherText Output File
CipherText Input File -> AES(decode) -> LZSS(decompress) -> PlainText Output File

This archive contains a simple and readable ANSI C implementation of LZSS
coding and decoding.  This implementation is not intended to be the best,
fastest, smallest, or any other performance related adjective.

bri3d - for his excellent description and implementation of a decompressor, upon which all this was based.

BUILDING
--------

command line.

USAGE
-----
Usage: lzss <options>

options:
  -c : Encode input file to output file.
  -d : Decode input file to output file.
  -i <filename> : Name of input file.
  -o <filename> : Name of output file.
  -h|?  : Print out command line options.

-c      Performs LZSS style compression on specified input file (see -i)
        writing the results to the specified output file (see -o).

-d      Decompresses the specified input file (see -i) writing the results to
        the specified output file (see -o).  Only files compressed by this
        program may be decompressed.

-i <filename>   The name of the input file.  There is no valid usage of this
                program without a specified input file.

-o <filename>   The name of the output file.  There is no valid usage of this
                program without a specified input file.
